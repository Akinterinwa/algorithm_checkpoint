# algorithm_checkpoint

This pseudocode describes the same algorithm that we discussed earlier. It initializes counters for length, word count, and vowel count. It uses a Set to efficiently check for vowels. It then iterates through each character in the sentence, incrementing the counters and making appropriate checks along the way. Finally, it displays the analysis results.
